A Deep Learning Based Intrusion Detection System for IIoT Networks

In recent years, the advancements in the network and cloud technologies have led to the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) in industrial sectors. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) comprises many connected devices and service data. IIoT networks are inherently vulnerable to cyberattacks as they depend on the associated networks for data exchange and communication. Therefore, it accentuates the necessity for ensuring the security of the IIoT systems for uninterrupted services. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely adopted as a promising solution to detect cyber threats and attacks on the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and IIoT networks. The existing IDS approaches lack generalisation, and involve misclassification errors and high false alarm rates. Considering these issues, a “Hybrid CNN + LSTM”, deep learning-based IDS is designed to identify malicious activities from IIoT networks. The proposed “CNN + LSTM” employs a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to identify the attack events and regular operations. The experiments are carried out using a benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and the outcomes demonstrate the dominance of
the proposed approach by achieving higher accuracy for the datasets respectively.
